		<div class="body">
			<u>Introduction</u>
			<p class="tab">The study of minerals is one of the most basic subjects in the geological sciences because the composition of nearly all rocks, sediment, and soil making up the earth’s crust is fundamentally a homogeneous or heterogenous arrangement of mineral crystals or particles. The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to familiarize the geology student with various physical properties of minerals, most of which can be observed in hand-sized specimens, to learn to use these properties to identify minerals and to develop a simplified classification system for minerals, and to properly identify certain ore body and/or rock-forming minerals that are important components of the earth’s crust.
			</p>
			<p class="tab" style="margin-top: 2em">The materials that form the earth's crust rarely occur as pure substances composed of the <b class="bold">atoms</b> of only one type of <b class="bold">element</b> (the metal ores of gold, silver, and copper are some exceptions); instead, they commonly occur as chemical <b class="bold">compounds</b> made up of several elements in a crystalline arrangement. These naturally occurring substances are called <b class="bold">minerals</b>. The internal structure and chemical properties of minerals are difficult to determine in hand samples, but many of their physical properties are useful for mineral identification in beginning laboratories of this type; identification that can be carried into field settings where rocks, composed of minerals, are observed in outcrop.
			</p>
			<p class="tab" style="margin-top: 2em">Any substance with a specific, orderly internal arrangement of atoms is a <b class="bold">crystalline</b> solid, but for it to be considered a mineral, it must be naturally occurring, inorganic, and have a definite chemical composition that can be expressed by a formula. For example, calcite is a common mineral associated with limestone, a sedimentary rock found abundantly in southern Indiana. Calcite is composed of the elements calcium (Ca), carbon (C) and oxygen (O) arranged into rhombohedral crystalline structures and having a chemical formula CaCO3 (one calcium atom and one carbon atom for every three oxygen). Other substances such as glass (in glass bottles, or volcanic glass) are <b class="bold">amorphous</b> (a substance that is solid but not crystalline because its atoms lack an orderly internal arrangement.
			</p>
			<p class="tab" style="margin-top: 2em">Over 2000 minerals are known, but only a few are abundant. This is largely due to the fact that the earth’s crust is composed almost entirely of only eight of 88 known naturally occurring elements. In order of decreasing abundance, these are: Oxygen (O), Silicon (Si), Aluminum (Al), Iron (Fe), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), and Sodium (Na).
			</p>
			<p class="newSection">
				<u>The Origin and Occurrence of Minerals</u>
			</p>
			<p class="tab">Minerals are formed by the process of <b class="bold">crystallization</b> (the growth of a solid from a liquid or gaseous material in which the constituent atoms combine in proper chemical proportions and an orderly three-dimensional, crystalline arrangements). They are often grouped into categories related to such characteristics as the dominant element (anion) or element group (complex anion) they contain, how/where they form, and what types of rock they result in or are associated with.
			</p>
			<p class="tab" style="margin-top: 2em">Crystallization can occur in several ways to form various rock types and metallic ore bodies. Four main processes are described below:
			</p>
			<ol id="crystallization">
				<li>1) Cooling a liquid below its melting point causes crystals to form. This process produces minerals during the solidification of <b class="bold">magma</b> (molten rock) to form various types of <b class="bold">igneous</b> rock.
				</li>
				<li>2) Evaporation of a salt solution (such as sea water) concentrates the ions dissolved within it. With continued evaporation, the remaining solution becomes saturated (it cannot hold any more ions), and any farther evaporation causes the ions to chemically bond and form crystals. The crystal solids then precipitate from the solution. This process is responsible for the formation of some types of chemical evaporites or chemical <b class="bold">sedimentary</b> rocks such as rock gypsum and rock salt
				</li>
				<li>3) Similarly, marine and freshwater micro- and macro-organisms can pull ions from solution to form protective exoskeletons through a process called <b class="bold">biomineralization</b>. When the creature dies, it sinks to the floor of the water body in which it lives; thick accumulations of such organisms or pieces of such organisms, form some types of chemical sedimentary rocks such as limestone and chert.
				</li>
				<li>4) Crystals may form by rearrangement of solid materials (recrystallization) through <b class="bold">diagenesis</b> and <b class="bold">metamorphism</b>. Diagenetic alteration involves solid-state changes at relatively low temperature and pressure, whereas metamorphism involves high temperatures and/or pressures. As these conditions become more extreme, or in the presence of groundwater or hydrothermal (hot-water) solutions, ions and atoms in solids become more mobile and can rearrange themselves (without actually melting) to become reoriented within a pressure field, and/or form new minerals with different compositions and structures. Recrystallization in this way may form realignment of existing minerals within a rock, new minerals with slightly altered composition, more intensely altered <b class="bold">metamorphic</b> rocks, and/or rich deposits of void-filling <b class="bold">metallic ores</b>.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="newSection">
				<u>Mineral Identification</u>
			</p>
			<p class="tab">Minerals may be identified and distinguished from one another in several ways that measure one or more of the mineral's unique physical and chemical properties. Several of these methods, such as X-ray diffraction and the polarizing petrographic microscope, require facilities and techniques which are generally beyond the scope of a survey level geology course. Instead, identifications in this lab exercise will be made on the basis of physical and chemical properties which may be determined by a geologist using hand specimens and/or field outcrops using only the naked eye and some simple equipment. The physical properties expressed by a mineral sample are a result of that mineral's unique chemical composition and crystalline structure. Several simple tools can aid in the identification of minerals, including a streak plate, magnet, hand lens, acid bottle, and several hardness tools (your finger nail, a penny, a steel nail, and a glass plate).
			</p>
			<p class="tab" style="margin-top: 2em">The following physical properties are useful in identifying minerals:</p>
			<p><d class="bold">Luster</d> - Luster is the way in which light is reflected from the surface of the mineral sample (Figure 1.1). It occurs as two major types, either metallic or nonmetallic. To have a metallic luster the mineral surface must have a shiny appearance similar to readily observable metals such as gold, silver, copper, brass, bronze, iron, or steel. Minerals with a nonmetallic luster may have surfaces that appear in a variety of textures:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Adamantine - brilliant luster typical of diamond
				</li>
				<li>
					Earthy - dull, clayey appearance
				</li>
				<li>
					Greasy - oily film appearance
				</li>
				<li>
					Pearly - milky sheen, like a pearl
				</li>
				<li>
					Resinous - mottled yellow and brown, waxy
				</li>
				<li>
					Silky - fibrous, like silk
				</li>
				<li>
					Vitreous - shiny, like glass
				</li>
				<li>
					Waxy - like a waxed finish
				</li>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em"><d class="bold">Color</d> - In many minerals, color can vary widely and is not a truly diagnostic property. However, for a few nonmetallic minerals, color is often distinctive.  The mineral biotite is usually brown to black, muscovite is colorless, olivine is olive-green, garnet is deep red, hornblende is black, and augite and chlorite are dark green (Figure 1.2).

			<p style="margin-top: 2em"><d class="bold">Streak</d> - Streak is the color of a mineral in powdered form.  It can be determined by scratching the mineral sample against a porcelain plate (Figure 1.3) and is very distinctive for many of the metallic minerals such as pyrite (dark gray), hematite (reddish-brown), limonite (yellowish-brown), and galena (gray).  Many nonmetallic minerals have a whitish streak, not particularly useful for identification.  Note:  If the mineral is harder than the streak plate, it will scratch the plate and leave a white powder unrelated to the mineral's streak.
